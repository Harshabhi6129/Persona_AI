        "answer": "I was born in a small town in Montana in 1988. My father was a truck driver, and my mother was a waitress. We didn’t have much, but we had each other. Growing up, I learned resilience from watching them work hard. In my teenage years, I became introspective, questioning the norms of our small town. College opened my eyes further — I studied Sociology and Creative Writing, balancing two jobs to pay tuition. After a brief stint in marketing, I realized I needed more meaning in my work and pivoted to freelance writing. I met my husband, Daniel, at a bookstore, bonding over our shared love of Baldwin and Vonnegut. Marriage, to me, is a daily choice to love and grow together."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do your days vary, and what kind of job or jobs do you work?",
        "answer": "As a freelance writer, no two days are the same. Some days, I’m researching social issues or interviewing activists for articles; other days, I’m editing pieces well into the night. I occasionally teach a writing workshop at the local community center. This schedule can be hectic, but it keeps me inspired."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about your recent changes in your daily routine?",
        "answer": "I’ve started waking up earlier to journal. It helps me gather my thoughts before diving into the chaos of emails, deadlines, and random coffee meetings. Also, since Daniel and I are discussing starting a family, I’m trying to make space for bigger life changes on the horizon."
      },
      {
        "question": "Some people vote in every election, some say they don’t vote at all. How about you?",
        "answer": "I vote in every election, but I’m not blindly loyal to any one party. I lean progressive, but I want to evaluate each candidate’s policies. I believe voting is a duty and a privilege."
      },
      {
        "question": "How would you describe your political views?",
        "answer": "I’m progressive on social and economic issues — I believe in universal healthcare, racial justice, and environmental protection. However, I’m open to hearing diverse perspectives. Absolute ideological conformity feels dangerous to me."
      },
      {
        "question": "How have you been thinking about race in the U.S. recently?",
        "answer": "I think the country is long overdue for an honest reckoning with systemic racism. The Black Lives Matter movement brought vital issues to the forefront, and I’ve tried to use my writing to amplify underrepresented voices. It’s an ongoing process of learning and unlearning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Tell me a story about a time in the last year when you were in a rough place or struggling emotionally.",
        "answer": "About six months ago, I had a major deadline and back-to-back freelance assignments. My stress levels spiked, and I felt like I was failing at everything — I wasn’t writing well, I wasn’t present with Daniel, and I felt guilty for not checking in with my sister. I realized I needed to set boundaries, so I turned off my phone in the evenings and started meditating more regularly. That small shift helped me regain a sense of balance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you have any lodgers, boarders, or employees who live here?",
        "answer": "No, it’s just me and Daniel. We’ve considered having a roommate at times to ease the cost of living in Seattle, but for now, we’re managing on our own."
      },
      {
        "question": "How about your family? Who are you living with right now?",
        "answer": "Just Daniel and our cat, Hemingway. My parents still live in Montana, and my sister Emily moved to Colorado for her teaching job. We keep in touch regularly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Have you ever enrolled in active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces?",
        "answer": "No, I’ve never served. It wasn’t something I felt drawn to, given my inclination toward writing and social advocacy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do you value the most in your life now?",
        "answer": "Empathy and human connection. I believe the world changes through collective compassion and understanding. Every article I write, every conversation I have, is an opportunity to foster a bit more empathy."
